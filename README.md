# MentalHealthAssistant

MentalHealthAssistant is an innovative Python application designed to monitor mental health in real time. It analyzes emotions through a webcam and stress levels through a microphone, offers personalized recommendations (including Spotify playlists) and provides a chat with an AI psychologist. The project includes a web version on Flask and a mobile application on Kivy, with support for authorization, API and data visualization.

## Main functions
- **Emotion Analysis**: Uses FER to recognize emotions from a webcam.
- **Stress Assessment**: Analyzes voice through MFCC, chromatic features and spectral contrast.
- **Personalization**: The neural network (PyTorch) adapts to the user.
- **Recommendations**: Integration with Spotify for music playlists.
- **AI psychologist**: Chat based on `distilgpt2` for support.
- **Web version**: Flask with JWT authorization, stress visualization and modern UI.
- **Mobile application**: Kivy with synchronization via API and improved interface.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam and microphone
- Spotify API keys (see below)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whotyc/MentalHealthAssistant.git

## Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python fer librosa sounddevice flask flask-jwt-extended numpy torch transformers spotipy kivy matplotlib requests aiohttp

##Configure the Spotify API:
Sign up for Spotify Developer.
Create an application and get the client_id and client_secret.
Paste them into both files (web_version.py and mobile_version.py ), replacing YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET.
Using
Launching the web version:
bash
Transfer
Copy
python web_version.py
Open up http://127.0.0.1:5000/login in the browser.
Register or log in.
Launching the mobile app:
bash
Transfer
Copy
python mobile_version.py
Enter your username and password to synchronize with the web version.
Functionality:
Video: Analyzes emotions and stress, displays recommendations.
Web: Two tabs â€” history (with stress graph) and chat with AI.
Mobile: Login screen and main screen with status, history and chat.
Project
structure web_version.py : A web application on Flask with an API.
mobile_version.py : Mobile app on Kivy.
mental_health.db: SQLite database for users, emotions, and chats.
Technical details
Security: JWT for authorization, session for username.
Performance: Asynchrony with asyncio in the web version.
AI: distilgpt2 for psychologist, PyTorch for personalization.
UI: CSS for the web, ScreenManager for Kivy.
Analysis: OpenCV (FER), librosa for audio, Matplotlib for graphs.
Limitations and improvements
Performance: Streaming video processing; requires asyncio-compatible OpenCV for full asynchrony.
AI: distilgpt2 is basic; to improve, connect an API (for example, xAI) or teach psychological dialogues on the dataset.
UI: Animations are possible (Bootstrap for web, KivyMD for mobile).
